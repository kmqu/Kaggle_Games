# Kaggle_Games

This repo houses the code used for my team's submissions to a Kaggle competition wherein the goal is to compete against other users to create an agent achieving the highest score in repeated rounds of 'Snake'.

greedy_agent is an implementation of an algorthim dictating to the agent to choose the move which brings the head of the snake closest to near food items while avoiding other players.

RL - Implementation contains an extention of greedy_agent. This is an implementation of the Deep Q-Network algorithm https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf via modification of a series of youtube tutorials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiSCh4H-GY4&list=PL_49VD9KwQ_OpleGtJhWD24JDrrmXYXEQ.
